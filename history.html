                Talisay City College (TCC) was established in June 2004 through the efforts of Atty. Eduardo "Eddiegul" R. Gullas during his term as city mayor.
                The college was created by Sangguniang Panlungsod Ordinance No. 2004-05, later amended by Ordinance No. 2005-15, authored by then City Councilor Richel N. Bacaltos.
                Dr. Tomas L. Ramos served as the first College Director. Atty. Gullas is known as the "Father of Talisay City College" for his key role in its foundation.
                Initially, TCC operated in the old municipal hall in Barangay Poblacion and offered Bachelor programs in Elementary Education (BEED), Secondary Education (BSED),
                Industrial Technology (BSIndTech), and Nursing (BSN). With support from Cebu Normal University, Cebu Technological University, and the University of the Visayas,
                 the college grew rapidly. More municipal buildings were converted into classrooms and laboratories to meet the increasing number of students.

                In 2006, the Bachelor of Science in Hotel and Restaurant Management (now Hospitality Management) was introduced. However, in 2011, 
                the Nursing program was discontinued due to financial constraints.
                Despite this, TCC achieved recognition for producing topnotchers in the Licensure Examination for Teachers (LET), 
                earning a spot among the country's top-performing schools in 2012.
                By 2019, TCC became a beneficiary of the <a style="color: #ffa000; text-decoration: none;" href="https://web.senate.gov.ph/republic_acts/ra%2010931.pdf" target="_blank"> Universal Access to Quality Tertiary Education Act (RA 10931)</a>, resulting in a surge of enrollees. The city government funded a five-story building with classrooms, a library, and an auditorium, enhancing the college’s facilities. Today, Talisay City College continues to promote academic excellence, producing skilled professionals dedicated to community service.
